This project an AI neural network written from scratch without any existing ai libraries. 
Behavior will be similar to TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Features will include neurons with weights and activation functions. Training via gradient descent back propagation.

This will be a feed forward network utilizing a perceptron architecture. 
The perceptron will function as a binary classifier that makes predictions based on a linear combination of input features. It takes one or more weighted inputs and returns a single binary output, either 1 or 0
